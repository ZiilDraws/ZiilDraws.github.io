	    <h2>DIGITAL ART</h2>
		<div class="inner-sec">
			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UwNhxYJ.png" class="mainimage" alt="Collection of ZiilDraws digital art">
			<p>i sometimes decide to do digital art.<br>this happens quite rarely but is probably at the same time the thing im the most productive in.<br>isn't that kinda sad?</p>
			<p>i draw in a very simple style, lineless with a very small amount of shading. i find it works quite well for me and my process. it isnt the best art style, but its mine, and thats how i like to do it.</p>
			<p>i may do digital art commissions, get in touch!</p>
			<p>you can find my arts on bluesky, furaffinity, in my telegram announcement channel, and possibly in some discord server. you can see the up to date stuff through the links on my links page.</p>

	    <h2>PHYSICAL PROJECTS</h2>
		<div class="inner-sec">
			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/NSXW2iX.png" class="mainimage" alt="Picture of the two masks I have made.">
			<p>i like working on physical projects but i do it far too seldom. whether its soldering, sewing, tinkering, carpentry, whatever - im all up in it. i love machines and am a proud pappy of a 3d printer (since thats the only thing that fits in the apartment).</p>
			<p>most notably i have made two fursuit masks, first the crow, then the owl. both of these characters are unnamed, but have their own respective flannel shirt.</p>
			<p>these masks are, dare i say it, terribly made. wearing them is always scary since it feels as if they may fall apart at any second. the upside to this is that they were cheap to make, with both combined costing less than a hundred bucks to make (including buying tools i did not have, but excluding those i already had).</p>
			<p>due to the quality issues mentioned above, these masks are not for sale and im not open for commissions. you would not want one of these - trust me.</p>
			<p>i usually post any furry-adjacent physical projects at the very least on my bluesky. just don't expect to see them too often!</p>

	    <h2>CODING</h2>
		<div class="inner-sec">
			<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0Yg7PzO.png" class="mainimage" alt="Picture of Lockner slacking off signifying my current aversion to coding.">
			<p>i come from a computer science background (a computer science furry??? no way) so i do a bit of coding occasionally. lately the motivation to has hit rock bottom considering ai and the like. i don't really want to use it, but programming without it feels futile so its a bit of a catch 22.</p>
			<p>if i do ever make any real coding projects you will find them on my github.</p>
